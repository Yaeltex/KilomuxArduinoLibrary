 * Description: This code drives an LED matrix with the outputs of the Kilomux shield.
 *              The example can be used with up to 8 rows and 8 columns, setting the ROWS and COLS labels accordingly.
 *              It's important to drive the columns and the rows with different ports (OUT-1 and OUT-2), and to specify 
 *              the port used for the columns in the label COL_PORT.
 *
