# Kilomux Shield Library

This is the arduino library for use with the Kilomux Shield.

Feel free to contribute!

Usually, examples and code are well commented, but it'd be nice if someone who knows how to use doxygen, can set up an html with the library documentation.
If you do, contact me, and I'll host it at our server.

If you have any questions, suggestions or comments about the shield, email us at franco@yaeltex.com.ar or post in Yaeltex's forum http://foro.yaeltex.com.ar

Cheers!
